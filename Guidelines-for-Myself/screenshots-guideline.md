# Screenshots for Portfolio

This folder contains screenshots of the Word Pop game in action. High-quality screenshots are essential for your portfolio as they give viewers an immediate visual understanding of your project.

## Required Screenshots

For a professional portfolio presentation, include the following screenshots:

1. **Main Game Screen (`gameplay.png`)** - Show the game during actual gameplay with bubbles floating
2. **Welcome Screen (`welcome.png`)** - Show the initial screen with difficulty options
3. **Settings Menu (`settings.png`)** - Display the settings modal with difficulty options
4. **Celebration Effect (`celebration.png`)** - Capture the celebration effect when completing a unit
5. **Game Over Screen (`game-over.png`)** - Show the end-of-game score summary

## Screenshot Tips

### For macOS:
- **Capture a portion of the screen**: Press `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then select the area
- **Capture a specific window**: Press `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then press `Space` and click on the window
- **Save screenshot to clipboard**: Add `Control` to the keyboard shortcuts above

### Best Practices:
1. **Resolution**: Take screenshots at 2x resolution, then resize if needed (1200-1600px wide is ideal)
2. **Crop Carefully**: Focus on the game interface without including too much browser UI
3. **Image Format**: Use PNG for best quality, or JPEG (quality 80%+) for smaller file sizes
4. **Optimization**: Use a tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to optimize images
5. **Consistent Dimensions**: Try to keep all screenshots with consistent dimensions
6. **Show Features**: Make sure each screenshot demonstrates a key feature of your game

## File Structure

Your screenshots should be named descriptively, with the main gameplay image referenced in the README:
